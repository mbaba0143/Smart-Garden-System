# Smart-Garden-System
A smart IoT garden automation system that senses soil moisture and controls water pump using Arduino and Blynk platform.
# Smart Garden System

This project is an IoT-based Smart Garden System that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels. It helps in saving water and maintaining healthy plants without manual effort.

## 💡 Key Features
- Automatic watering when soil is dry
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Mobile app control using Blynk (or ThingSpeak)
- Low-cost and eco-friendly solution

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno / NodeMCU
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- DHT11 Sensor (Temperature + Humidity)
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Blynk App (IoT platform)

## 👨‍💻 My Role
- Designed and implemented the complete circuit
- Developed Arduino code for automation
- Connected sensors and IoT platform
- Tested and deployed the full system

## 📌 Note
Code and circuit files will be uploaded soon.
